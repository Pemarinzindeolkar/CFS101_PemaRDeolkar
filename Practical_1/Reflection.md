For this assignment, I explored a wide range of Python fundamentals, starting with variables and basic data types, including booleans, numbers, and strings. I practiced using boolean logic such as `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to perform logical checks and print outcomes. Working with numbers, I managed both integers and floats, performed arithmetic calculations, and learned how to convert between types, like turning strings to numbers and vice versa. Type conversion taught me about handling exceptions, especially when invalid values are parsed, and I learned to use try-except blocks to keep my programs from crashing.

Creating and manipulating data structures was another key area of my work. I built dictionaries and lists, accessed their values, added new items, and gracefully handled errors like missing keys using exception handling. I also became comfortable using arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators to manipulate and compare values. My practice with control structures involved writing if-elif-else chains to make decisions, and using for and while loops for iteration, as well as break and continue to control loop flow. This helped me understand the flow and logic behind program execution.

Defining functions was a major step in writing reusable code. I practiced writing functions with positional and default parameters, returning values, and even recursive functions for problems like calculating factorials and Fibonacci numbers. Scoping rules in Python became clear when I learned the difference between local, global, and nonlocal variables by writing nested and global-variable-modifying functions. Finally, I performed file operations, such as creating, writing, and reading text and binary files, working with CSVs, and managing files and directories on disk.

Throughout these tasks, I learned that careful organization of code and proactive error handling make my scripts much more robust and easier to debug. I faced challenges with type errors during conversion and with KeyErrors in dictionaries; I overcame these by practicing exception handling and reviewing error messages and outputs, referencing related screenshots for confirmation. These examples highlighted for me how debugging and experimenting are essential parts of learning to code. Overall, this practical strengthened my coding foundations and increased my confidence in using Python for real-world problem solving.
