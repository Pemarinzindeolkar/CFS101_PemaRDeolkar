For these assignments, I worked on a variety of classic algorithm and data structure problems using Python. Each python file I completed represented a unique topic or challenge such as reversing a linked list, removing duplicates, working with n-th nodes, merging sorted lists, building a stack using queues, solving stock and substring problems, and validating anagrams, palindromes, and parenthesis. I also tackled core algorithmic problems like two-sum and three-sum.<br>

Throughout this process, I became more comfortable building and manipulating different data structures—especially linked lists and stacks—and applying algorithmic thinking to solve targeted problems. I practiced how to carefully manage node references for linked lists, work with multiple pointers or indices, and write clear logical checks for problems involving strings or arrays. Many tasks required attention to edge cases—like empty inputs, duplicates, or odd input combinations—which improved my debugging skills and reminded me to test thoroughly.<br>

As I worked, I learned that even small changes in code structure can dramatically affect the logic and output. For stack and queue-based problems, it was important to carefully manage the pushing and popping of elements to avoid errors. Similarly, validation tasks (like anagram or palindrome checks) taught me to think about string manipulation and character counts from different angles. The visuals and outputs for each assignment were helpful for step-by-step verification.<br>

I faced a few challenges, especially in handling linked list operations and ensuring all edge cases were addressed. Debugging small mistakes, such as incorrect pointer updates or overlooked conditions, was sometimes tricky, but seeing the output screenshots helped me confirm my fixes were correct. Overall, I developed a stronger grasp of practical coding patterns in Python for data structures and algorithms, became more confident with step-by-step reasoning, and solidified my ability to independently solve and test standard coding interview problems.<br>
