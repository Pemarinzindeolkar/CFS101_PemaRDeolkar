For Practical 3, I worked with fundamental data structures in Python by designing and implementing a Stack class and a Queue class from scratch. In the Stack module, I learned to define methods for basic operations such as checking if the stack is empty, pushing items onto it, popping the top item, peeking at the current top without removal, and getting the stack's size. By instantiating a Stack and pushing integers 1, 2, and 3 onto it, I demonstrated the LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior by popping the top item, confirming it returned 3, and then using peek and size to confirm the remaining stack contents.

Similarly, in the Queue module, I defined a Queue class using Python's collections.deque to efficiently implement queue operations. I created custom methods to check if the queue is empty, enqueue (add) new tasks, dequeue (remove) items from the front, peek at the front item, and check the size. After enqueuing three tasks, I tested the FIFO (First In, First Out) property by dequeuing "Task 1", using peek to check the new front, and validating the size. 

Throughout these exercises, I learned first hand how stacks and queues operate differently and why their distinct behaviors are useful in programming. One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the pop and dequeue methods handled empty data structures gracefully, to avoid crashing the program. Careful use of conditional checks and clear error messages helped solve this. I also tested my implementation using the provided expected outputs and screenshots to verify that my code functioned correctly. Overall, this practical gave me a deeper understanding of abstract data types, object-oriented design, and how to translate theory into functional Python programs.
